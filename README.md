# Prismic Portfolio Starter

Welcome to the **Prismic Portfolio Starter** project! This is an easy-to-use and customizable portfolio starter built with **Next.js 15**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Tailwind Typography**, and **Framer Motion**. The goal is to provide a **modern, scalable portfolio template** that developers can effortlessly customize and use to showcase their work.

## About This Project
